Hello!
You're trying to compile nginx from sources.
To do this,
Download the latest stable release:
wget http://nginx.org/download/nginx-1.10.2.tar.gz
Unzip it:
tar zxf nginx-1.10.2.tar.gz

Before building, figure out what nginx options you'd like to set.
All default nginx options can be set by passing arguments to nginx-<x.x.x>/configure
For example,
./configure --prefix=</path/to/installation/directory>
will set the directory that 'make install' uses.
This is very handy; all nginx configuration files as well as the executable end up in this directory.
This enables you to have several customized nginx setups running on the same system.

For this demonstration, run:
./configure_nginx.sh
This enters the options that we're interested in.
Then, run:
cd nignx-1.10.2
make
make install

or:
make -C nginx-1.10.2
make -C nginx-1.10.2 install

All files will now be found in build/
For example, to start nginx run:
./build/sbin/nginx
or run
./start_nginx.sh

But don't forget to change the default port first.

Stop nginx with:
./build/sbin/nginx -s quit
or:
./stop_nginx.sh

The nginx.conf file can be found in:
./build/conf/nginx.conf

Go change:
http {
    server {
        listen       80;
To something else (10000?).

Good luck!
